Ryotaro Mitsuboshi is a Ph. D. student 
studying machine learning algorithms and theories.  
His current interest is theoretically guaranteed boosting algorithms.  
He uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 
[C](https://clang.llvm.org/)/[C++](https://isocpp.org/), 
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/), and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) 
for programming.
